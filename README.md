# VideoFrameExtractor
 This is Python code to extract frames from a video.
 
A few days back, I needed to extract the frames from a video. I searched the web and found many websites, but no one served my purpose. They are restricted in one way or another, so I made this script that can read a video and save the frames in output folders that can be easily accessed.

In this, I used the openCV.

In this demo, I am using a video from [invideo.ai](https://ai.invideo.io/)
