# VideoFrameExtractor
 This is Python code to extract frames from a video.
 
A few days back I found a need to extract the frames from a video, and I searched the web and found many websites but no one served my purpose, they are restricted in one or another way, so I made this script which can read a video and save the frames in output folders that can be easily accessed.

In this, I used the openCV.

In this demo, I am using a video from [invideo.ai](https://ai.invideo.io/)
